# Food Ordering System
This project was made by me as part of my academic curriculum. Here I have created a GUI Fast Food Restaurant System in Python using function definition, variable declaration, Object Entry, Object Label, Object Button, CheckButtons and ComboBox. GUI tutorials on YouTube were used as reference.
